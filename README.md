# Printful API Integration


    Persistent File Caching: Implemented a file caching mechanism to store API responses for faster retrieval.
    API Integration: Utilized Guzzle library to interact with the Printful Catalog API for fetching product details and size tables.
    CLI Output: Product information and size tables can be viewed in the command-line interface (CLI) by running the index.php script.
    Composer Autoloading: Composer is used for autoloading classes and managing dependencies.
    Unit Testing: Included PHPUnit tests to ensure the functionality of the caching mechanism and API integration.

 # Usage

    Clone the repository.
    Run composer install to install dependencies.
    Execute php index.php in the command line to see the product information and size tables.

# Running Tests

    Run composer test to execute PHPUnit tests and ensure the correctness of the caching mechanism and API integration.
